Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2024-05-26
  Features:
    - Mining resources are now accounted for in the chain. This means uranium ore is no longer T0
    - Offshore pumps are now accounted for in the chain
  Changes:
    - Refactored almost the entire tier calculation. Should now have less of a chance of dependency bugs and be mostly easier to read.
  Bugfixes:
    - Now unhighlights when you click anywhere on the Tier Menu
    - Rocket products now consider building the rocket instead of just the silo
    - Clicking on fluids now also highlight their dependents
    - Should no longer crash when changing the ignored recipes after loading a game
    - Should actually update base items when the settings change
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.1
Date: 2024-05-24
  Features:
    - Clicking on an item now highlights its dependents
    - Settings are now global and the list will be updated to match the settings
    - Add a setting to toggle on whether or not to consider technology when calculating
  Optimizations:
    - Now marks incalculable items and unmarks them once the blocking item is calculated
  Changes:
    - Left-most items are no longer reliably simpler than right-most items
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed overriden base items not appearing in the tierlist
    - Fixed ignored recipes not being ignored
    - Fixed the technology decrement applying even when the tier was determined by the prerequesite instead of items
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.2.0
Date: 2024-05-20
  Major Features:
    - Now has a UI to display the tiers!
  Features:
    - Add setting to decrement a technology tier. Meaning green science items can share a row with green science
  Changes:
    - Refactored the monolithic data-final-fixes.lua into multiple files
    - Changed from a startup script to runtime
    - Add MIT License I forgor to
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a handful of bugs that I spotted while refactoring to runtime. Theoretically added just as many bugs though.
    - Caught a possible invalid science pack not resulting in an invalid technology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2024-05-18
  Features:
    - Burnable fuels now kind of work. Not all machines that can burn are currently being grabbed. To be refined
    - Rocket launch products now work. This means you can calculate space-science-pack instead of cobbling together its ingredients
  Bugfixes:
    - Now will no longer crash on recipes with no results
    - A category with no machines is now handled properly instead of relying on the safety net of pcall
    - A category with no valid machines now signals as invalid instead of leaking an infinity
  Changes:
    - Will only log when given an invalid type in startup settings, rather than halting it with an error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2024-05-18
  Bugfixes:
    - Now has a pcall so it should just log an error instead of halting startup
    - Should now gracefully handle recipes that can't be unlocked (at least via research)
    - Added MoreSciencePacks-for1_1 as a hidden dependency so it properly considers the added science
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2024-05-17
  Features:
    - Add setting to define what items gets their tiers calculated
    - Add setting to directly set values as base items
    - Add setting to ignore problematic recipes
  Bugfixes:
    - Properly determine if a recipe is enabled by default
    - Output to log instead of only stdout
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2024-05-12
  Major Features:
    - Mostly kind of works now!
